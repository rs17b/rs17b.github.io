                <p class="bio">
                    I am a software engineer based in NYC who is passionate about performance, reliability, efficiency, and debugging, at scale. With over 15 years of industry experience, I have a proven track record for technical leadership, tackling ambiguous problems, and building cross-functional relationships, all while driving team and org goals.

                    I’ve led distributed ML observability and iOS performance initiatives at Meta, built engaging mobile experiences as an iOS Engineer at Dow Jones, and co-founded Campbell/Gambill Designs to craft custom iOS apps.
